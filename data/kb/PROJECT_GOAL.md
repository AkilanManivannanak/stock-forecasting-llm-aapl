Project Goal

Build a production-style stock forecasting system for AAPL that demonstrates:
1) data ingestion (Yahoo Finance OHLCV)
2) feature engineering (technical indicators + lags)
3) model training and evaluation with strong baselines
4) walk-forward evaluation and regime analysis (bull, bear, sideways)
5) model serving via FastAPI endpoints
6) a grounded RAG copilot that answers questions using only repo docs and experiment outputs
